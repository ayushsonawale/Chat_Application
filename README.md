<h1 align="center">Chat_Application</h1>
I Developed a Chat_Application which based on CUI using java language.

# Introductions 
In above application we create two programs as Client and Server.
In side Client application we have to create socket object which connect to Server by specifying (IP address, Port number).
Inside Server application we have to create two objects one for server socket and second for socket.
To maintain the consistency between Client and Server we use same naming convention.
